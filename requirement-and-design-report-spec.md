This is a group project. As such, you will all receive the same grade and are all responsible for any academic misconduct.

Referencing & Avoiding Academic Misconduct
It is serious Academic Misconduct to pass off the work of others (including peers or AI-generated content) as your own. You should not permit colleagues to copy from you.
Sources must be appropriately and properly acknowledged every time reference is made to another’s work, using the Harvard or Vancouver Referencing system. Failure to do so amounts to plagiarism which breaches university regulations and falls short of the Academic Integrity expected in the department and university.

Reminder: It is your responsibility to be familiar with the department’s academic misconduct policy, and its guidance around the use of generative AI tools: [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/handbook/examinations#academicmisconduct](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/handbook/examinations#academicmisconduct)

Assignment Brief

Introduction
You have been given a specification by the client (available at this page: [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs261/project/](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs261/project/)).
Your job is to design a system that will achieve the client’s requests – ensuring that all core feature requests are present. Your design will consist of two documents, a requirements analysis report and a planning & design document.

Requirements Analysis Report
Each team is required to provide a Requirements Analysis Report. This will document your teams understanding of the specification. As well as addressing the specification itself, the report should also document any decisions that have been made in terms of group structure. The roles of each member should be described and justified. The document should provide a list of requirements that your team have decided will meet the customer's needs.
A requirements analysis report should provide an outline of the features that the final solution will provide. Remember that requirements need to be detailed, justified and verifiable. Consider your validation process carefully, along with why you've chosen to include certain features.
This part of your first deliverable must not exceed five sides of A4, not including references. Any appendices or other attachments will be removed.

Planning and Design Document
This should address the design of your software solution together with a detailed plan as to how (and when) this design is to be implemented. There are a number of things to consider in the design of software systems, including:
Extensibility – how you can extend your solution given increasing demands; Robustness – how your solution will tolerate unpredictable or invalid input;
Reliability – how the system will perform under everyday conditions;
Correctness – how accurately your solution meets the requirements of the customer;
Compatibility and portability – how easy your proposed system is to install and execute;
Modularity and reuse – how well your system is divided into independent components and whether you have reused existing code;
Security – whether your system can withstand hostile acts and influences;
Fault-tolerance – whether your system can withstand and recover from component failure.
This list is not exhaustive and there will be other concerns which your group will want to address. You will also want to adopt trusted design patterns or design methodologies to provide a template for the actual design of your system. No one method will be favoured (by the assessors) over another, but you will be graded on the process of selecting an appropriate methodology and your use of it.
Each group must submit one Planning and Design Document and the report itself must not exceed ten sides of A4, excluding references. Any appendices or other attachments will be removed.

Writing Quality (20%)

5
Requirements are sufficiently detailed, well organised and comprehensive. It is clear what the system’s overall functionalities will be, and which requirements are considered the most vital. The limits of the system are clear. There is a clear validation process.
Requirements directly relate to the specification and address all the client’s requests and concerns. Additional features have a clear purpose and will enhance the experience sought by the client.
All major requirements are clearly linked to either a client request or are shown to contribute to that client request. Justifications should be reasonable, logical, and ideally evidenced either by the specification or through additional research. The team has shown a clear and deep understanding of the key aspects of the system.
Team roles are explained, with a clear justification for each role selected.
Report is written in high quality, formal language. The meaning of each element is clear and there are no grammatical or spelling errors.

4
Requirements are reasonably detailed, though some key technical elements may not be clear. The system’s main functionalities are evident, though the limits of the system may not be understood. There is a reasonable ordering of the requirements. The validation process is only vaguely described.
Requirements mostly related to the specification and core aspects of the client’s requests have been addressed. Some additional features may seem superfluous or not contribute effectively to the user experience.
Only some requirements are justified – mostly using the specification as a source of evidence. Some justifications may rely on the team’s intuition and not provide evidence. The team has shown an understanding of the system, but some desired features may not be present.
Team roles are present, but there may be minimal or no discussion about management and organisation.
Report is written in reasonable formal language, and the meaning of each element is mostly clear. At times, clarity may be obscured by poor sentence structure, grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.

3
Requirements are not detailed, and key elements may be poorly defined. The system’s main functionalities are evident, though the limits of the system may not be understood. There is a poor ordering of the requirements. There may be no validation process, or only a vague description.
Requirements are mostly related to the specification, but some key elements requested by the customer may be missing. Additional features may seem superfluous, or their contribution is poorly demonstrated.
Requirements are poorly justified – with incorrect use of the specification as a source of evidence. The majority of justifications rely on the team’s intuition and do not provide evidence. The team has shown an understanding of the system, but elements have been misinterpreted.
Team roles are present, but lack detail in their description. There is no discussion about management and organisation.
Report is written in reasonably formal language, but meaning is obscured in many places. Clarity is consistently obscured by poor sentence structure, grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.

2
Requirements lack detail, using vague and undefined terms. The system’s functionality is perhaps evident, but there will be many elements that are not properly defined. There is no logic to the order of the requirements, nor is it evident what elements are considered the most vital.
Requirements attempt to address client requests, but do not provide a system that will effectively achieve the expected user experience. Many features may be unrelated to the specification, or their contribution unclear.
Justifications are either poor. There is only minimal reference to the specification, and some reasoning may be illogical. There is no evidence of additional research. The team may have misunderstood the specification and focused on the wrong elements of the system, with several desired features missing.
Team roles are not sufficiently explained, and some are absent entirely.
Report is poorly written, with many grammatical or spelling errors. Clarity is poor and there may be informal language used throughout.

1
Requirements lack detail, using vague and undefined terms. The system’s functionality is not evident, with the majority of elements undefined. Requirements are not organised or prioritised and may even be incomplete.
Requirements do not address client requests and do not provide a system that will achieve the expected user experience. Most features may be unrelated to the specification, and their contribution is unclear.
Justifications are mostly absent. There is no mention of the specification, and the reasoning is often illogical. There is no evidence of additional research. The team have clearly misunderstood d part of all of the specification and focused on the wrong elements of the system, with several desired features missing.
Team roles are only briefly explained, if at all. Many roles may be absent.
Report is poorly written, with few words spelt correctly. Understanding passages is difficult to impossible and there is heavy use of informal language throughout.

5
The design proposed will achieve the requirements. The design is particularly inventive and robust – ensuring that all the client’s needs are met. There may be additional expansions discussed. The use cases of the system are clearly defined.
The design is detailed, with appropriate technology used to achieve each element. Design patterns may be used effectively, providing additional depth and robustness to the design. There is a thorough consideration of testing and validation in the design.
The design technology and choices are thoroughly justified. There may be some element of market research to highlight appropriate technology. Justifications rely heavily on external authorities and do not rely heavily on the group’s own internal opinions.
The methodology is appropriate and applied robustly. There is a clear timeline of development, and each team member’s role during each element is clear. The methodology choice is justified thoroughly.
Report is written in high quality, formal language. The meaning of each element is clear and there are no grammatical or spelling errors.

4
The design proposed will achieve the majority of the requirements. The design will be robust and ensure the majority of the client’s needs are met. There may be an additional expansion discussed. System use cases are discussed.
The design is reasonably detailed, and appropriate technology is used for the majority of the elements. Design patterns may be present, and used reasonably well. There is a good discussion of testing and validation.
The design technology and choices are reasonably well justified. There are hints of market research to help highlight appropriate choices. Justifications make good use of external authorities, but there may be some justifications utilising the group’s opinions.
The methodology is appropriate and applied reasonably well. There is a clear timeline of development, with the majority of the team’s role in each element described. The methodology choice is reasonably well justified.
Report is written in reasonable formal language, and the meaning of each element is mostly clear. At times, clarity may be obscured by poor sentence structure, grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.

3
The design proposed will achieve the majority of the requirements. The design may lack robustness, and not clearly demonstrate how the client’s needs will be met. Design may not discuss additional features, and the use case discussion will be fairly basic.
The design is appropriate, though some elements may lack clarity of use an inappropriate technology. Design patterns are applied in a basic matter if present. There is some discussion of testing and validation.
The design’s technology and choices are justified. The choices are assumed to be appropriate, and justifications will make some use of an external authority. Many justifications may use the group’s own internal opinions.
The methodology is mostly appropriate and applied reasonably well. There is a timeline, but it may lack detail, and the team’s exact roles during each element may be undefined. The methodology’s justification may be brief.
Report is written in reasonably formal language, but meaning is obscured in many places. Clarity is consistently obscured by poor sentence structure, grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.

2
The design does not achieve all the requirements and lacks robustness. It is unclear how client needs will be met. Use cases will be vague, if present.
The design is unclear and may be inappropriate in some areas. There is a lack of formal methods and approaches. Testing and validation is only briefly mentioned.
The technology and design choices lack meaningful justification. There is some evidence of research, but nearly all justifications stem from the group’s internal opinions.
The methodology is inappropriate in many places and applied very basically. The timeline is lacking in any detail, and the team’s roles during each element are absent. There is minimal justification of the methodology.
Report is poorly written, with many grammatical or spelling errors. Clarity is poor and there may be informal language used throughout.

1
The design does not achieve the majority of the requirements and does not meet the majority of the client’s needs. Use of the system is undefined.
The design is unclear, and often inappropriate. Design lacks any formal methods or validation.
There is no meaningful justification and little to no evidence of research. All justifications stem from the group’s own opinion.
The methodology is unclear, or lacking in detail. It is not applied well and there is a lack of meaningful timeline.
Report is poorly written, with few words spelt correctly. Understanding passages is difficult to impossible and there is heavy use of informal language throughout.
