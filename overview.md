Group Software Development Project
Specification
The specification from the customer can be found here.Link opens in a new window

You should consider this brief carefully, utilising its content to produce the following deliverables, as discussed within the lecture content.

Client Consultation
On February 20th at 2pm in MS.02, you will have the opportunity to ask the client questions directly, to help clarify your design process.

This is notably after you have already submitted your design and requirements, and so you should take this opportunity to check you're designing something that will meet the client's needs. Remember - in all software projects that we must sometimes adjust our plans.

This consultation will be an open format - the client will be present, and will answer questions submitted both anonymously and live from the audience.

Your entire team is not required to attend this consultation, but it is highly recommended that you engage with this opportunity to the full extent. This will be your only opportunity to discuss your ideas with the client and truly understand what they are looking for, beyond the specification provided above.

Deliverables
There are a number of deliverables to this project. Each will contribute to your final project mark, so it is important not to ignore or miss any of the deadlines. Just as in real-world software development projects there will be a penalty for late- or non-submission.

Requirements Analysis Report (10%)
Each team is required to provide a Requirements Analysis Report. This will document your teams understanding of the specification. As well as addressing the specification itself, the report should also document any decisions that have been made in terms of group management (i.e. how you have organized yourselves to meet the goals of this project, how often you will meet, how you will address decision making etc.) and provide a list of requirements that your team have decided will meet the customer's needs.

A requirements analysis report should provide an outline of the features that the final solution will provide. Remember that requirements need to be detailed, justified and verifiable. Consider your validation process carefully, along with why you've chosen to include certain features.

Planning and Design Document (10%)
You are also required to submit a Planning and Design Document. This should address the design of your software solution together with a detailed plan as to how (and when) this design is to be implemented. There are a number of things to consider in the design of software systems, including:

Extensibility – how you can extend your solution given increasing demands; Robustness – how your solution will tolerate unpredictable or invalid input;

Reliability – how the system will perform under everyday conditions;

Correctness – how accurately your solution meets the requirements of the customer;

Compatibility and portability – how easy your proposed system is to install and execute;

Modularity and reuse – how well your system is divided into independent components and whether you have reused existing code;

Security – whether your system can withstand hostile acts and influences;

Fault-tolerance – whether your system can withstand and recover from component failure.

This list is not exhaustive and there will be other concerns which your group will want to address. You will also want to adopt trusted design patterns or design methodologies to provide a template for the actual design of your system. No one method will be favoured (by the assessors) over another, but you will be graded on the process of selecting an appropriate methodology and your use of it.

Each group will have to submit these two short reports on tabula on Monday 9th February 2026. Each member of the team should submit these reports along with a team contribution form for the first half of the project (see below).

The Video Presentation (15%)
To showcase your product, and demonstrate that you have met the requirements asked for by the customer, your group must make a video presentation. This presentation should showcase the product, highlight its interesting features, walk through typical use cases and discuss how you went about meeting the requirements of the product. This is your chance to show why your product is the one the customer wants and highlight the hard work your team has put into the product.

Your video should be around 5 minutes long (and no more than 10). Think of the best way to showcase your product - and which particular features you want to focus on. You should also make sure to discuss any complex aspects, such as machine learning models, so that the customer is aware of what is going on in the back-end as well as the front-end.

In addition, you should submit the code base for your system. Groups that do not submit their code base will be given a mark of 0%.

This video should be submitted by Noon on Monday 16th March 2026.

Final Individual Report (50%)
Each student is required to submit a final report on Monday 20th April 2025. This final report needs to cover all aspects of the project, from group organisation and management, to implementation of solution, use cases and testing.

This report should highlight the core features of the system, evaluate how well they meet the client’s needs, show how the system was validation and evaluate your team’s methodology.

This report should focus on critical analysis. While the system should be described (in your own words, demonstrating your own understanding), the key element is to evaluate the overall software engineering process.

This includes:

The requirements and design. How well did they meet the specification?
The development process. Was the technology appropriate? How well did the team achieve the requirements?
The system itself. Was the system complete? How well was it validated? What features were missing?
The methodology and the team. Did the team stick to a schedule? Was the methodology followed and effective? How well did the team communicate and collaborate?
Your individual contribution. What skills did you develop? What did you contribute to the system?
This report is not a technical manual – it is about the process of software development. You should make sure your evaluations and critique are appropriate and detailed.

Peer Assessment (15%)
Peer review is an important part of the software development process. It can be important to feedback to each other about your strengths and weaknesses so that you can improve. As such it is the responsibility of each team member to provide a peer review assessment report.

This document will consist of evaluations of each other member of your team (not including yourself).

Each team member should be evaluated across the following 5 criteria:

Contribution: Did the team member complete their tasks? Did they take on additional responsibilities?
Quality of Work: Did the team member produce high quality work? Did this work integrate well into the system?
Collaboration: Did the team member take feedback onboard? Did they provide feedback and thoughts on other aspects of the project?
Communication: Did the team member keep others informed on their progress? Did they ensure others understood they part of the project?
Attitude: Did the team member contribute to a positive work environment? Were they enthusiastically engaged with the project?
Each team member should receive a score between 0 and 3 for each of these five categories. Please see below for guidance on what each score means in each category.

In addition, you should provide a paragraph of feedback for each team mate to justify the marks provided.

If you do not provide a paragraph of feedback, your marks may be discounted. If we discount multiple sets of your marks (i.e. you did not provide feedback for multiple team members), you will receive a 0 for this submission.

Calculating Your Mark
The mark you receive for this submission will be determined based on the marks provided by other team members, provided that you have submitted your own peer review.

For each category, you will receive the average mark awarded to you from the other submissions from your team (counting only those that submitted and were not discounted).

Importantly: If you do not submit this peer review, you will receive a 0 for the submission regardless of what scores your team mates provide.

This report should be submitted at the same time as the final report, Monday 20th April 2025.

Adding it all up
Each deliverable states how much it contributes to your final grade for this module.

Important, the requirements, design document and group presentation are group marks. Each member of the team will receive the same mark for these deliverables.

You mark for the peer review will be determined by your team mates, as described above.

The mark for the final report is an individual mark. Each team member will receive their own, individual, mark for this deliverable.

Project teams
The project teams have already been pre-selected. Each consists of six members and you will notice that each group has a mixture of degree disciplines (CS, DM, CMS etc).

The pre-selection of group members is an important part of making this project realistic. You will find that when you go out into industry that you are placed in a team to work. You rarely have any choice as to who you are working with, and you will probably move between teams / departments regularly as you make your way up the career ladder. If you want to succeed, it is important that you make your team work. The members in your group will have lots of different skills – some may be better at programming, but less good at presentations; some may be good organisers, but not good at building testing scripts. It is not necessary for everyone in each group to do everything, although you should make sure that the effort is evenly spread and that no one feels aggrieved by the amount of work being put in by others. At the end of the project you will be required to rate everyone’s input and ideally this should be fairly even.

If you find that your group is not working, for whatever reason, then do please talk to Dr. James Archbold for advice.
